# athena-reconnection_decks
This repository contains generator files for problems involving reconnecting current sheets run with Athena++ on Purdue ANVIL

Here you can find two problem generators:
\item `reconnection.cpp`
\item `reconnection_shear.cpp`

The first one is https://github.com/xiaocanli/athena_reconnection
Once Athena++ is installed, the problem generators can be put in `athena\src\pgen`.
